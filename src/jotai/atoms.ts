I want to create a React component, but I don't know where to start. 
Here's what I've tried so far:

Can you help me improve or correct this?  Could you also give me some best practices to follow?  What should I consider for styling?  Thanks!`,

I need to integrate a REST API into my project, but I'm having some trouble. 
Here's the code I've written:

    description: `Hi, Pixel! How's it going? üòÑ
I'm styling a component with CSS Modules, but the styles aren't being applied correctly. 
This is my component code:

\`\`\`jsx
// Add your component here
\`\`\`

And here are the styles:

\`\`\`css
/* Add your CSS here */
\`\`\`

Can you check if I'm doing something wrong? Are there any common pitfalls with CSS Modules I should be aware of?  Are there alternative styling solutions you recommend?`,

    description: `Hi, Pixel! ‚ú®
I'm working on a form and would like to add validation to it. 
Here's the basic form I've created:

\`\`\`html
<!-- Add your form here -->
\`\`\`

And this is the JavaScript code I've used so far:

\`\`\`javascript
// Add your validation code here
\`\`\`

Can you suggest an approach to improve the validations?  Should I use built-in HTML validation attributes, a JavaScript library, or a custom solution?  How can I provide helpful error messages to the user?`,
